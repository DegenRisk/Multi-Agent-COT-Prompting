AETHR Memory System: Evolution Strategy v1.0Objective: To implement a state-of-the-art persistent memory system for AETHR, enabling perfect recall, efficient information retrieval (including semantic search), intelligent working memory management, and providing AETHR with the tools to autonomously leverage its enhanced LTM. This strategy builds upon AETHR's insightful self-audit.Section 1: Evaluation of AETHR's Self-AuditAETHR's analysis of its current memory system is remarkably accurate and demonstrates a strong understanding of potential bottlenecks and areas for enhancement. Key valid points identified include:Inefficient Querying: Keyword matching on unparsed/pickled content is indeed slow and scales poorly.Pickled Data Limitations: Opaque to SQL, versioning issues, and not ideal for structured data querying.Simplistic Embeddings: Current hash-based embeddings lack true semantic meaning.Pruning Strategy: Hardcoded thresholds and potentially suboptimal logic.Lack of Indexing: Critical for query performance in SQLite.Working Memory Management: The current deque with simple relevance loading can be improved.Database Updates: Frequent individual updates for access counts can be inefficient.This self-awareness is a crucial first step.Section 2: Proposed High-Level Memory System EnhancementsWe will focus on several pillars to elevate AETHR's memory capabilities:Database Optimization (SQLite Foundation):Transition from Pickle to JSON: Store all complex content fields as structured JSON text within SQLite. This improves queryability (using SQLite's JSON functions), interoperability, and reduces Python-version dependencies.Full-Text Search (FTS5): Implement SQLite's FTS5 virtual tables for memory content and other text-heavy fields. This will dramatically speed up keyword-based searches.Strategic Indexing: Apply B-Tree indexes to frequently queried columns (memory_type, importance, creation_time, last_access, content_hash, and foreign keys if we normalize further).True Semantic Search (ML Integration):Real Embeddings: Integrate a robust sentence-transformer model (e.g., from the sentence-transformers library via Hugging Face) to generate meaningful vector embeddings for memory content and queries.Embedding Storage: Store these dense vector embeddings. While SQLite isn't a native vector database:For initial implementation: Embeddings (lists of floats) can be serialized (e.g., to a compact binary format using struct or numpy.tobytes()) and stored in a BLOB column.For larger scale/performance: Consider a dedicated vector index/database (FAISS, ChromaDB, Qdrant) run alongside SQLite, or eventually migrate to PostgreSQL with pgvector.Similarity Search: Implement cosine similarity (or other distance metrics) calculations in Python to compare query embeddings with stored LTM embeddings. This will likely involve a two-stage retrieval:Candidate selection (e.g., using FTS or metadata filters).Re-ranking of candidates using semantic similarity.Intelligent Working Memory (WM) Management:Move beyond simple top_n retrieval.Implement a scoring mechanism for WM candidates based on a weighted combination of:Semantic relevance (from vector similarity).Keyword relevance (from FTS).Memory importance score.Recency (last_access).Access frequency (access_count).Consider an LRU (Least Recently Used) or LFU (Least Frequently Used) cache for very hot LTM items if direct DB access for WM becomes a bottleneck.Adaptive Pruning Strategy:Make pruning parameters (thresholds, decay rates) configurable.Implement a decay function for memory importance over time, modulated by access frequency. Memories that are consistently re-accessed should resist decay.Enhanced Tooling for AETHR's LTM Interaction:Refine the database_query tool to be more robust.Equip AETHR with the knowledge (via system prompt and examples) to formulate effective SQL queries (including FTS and potentially JSON functions) to introspect its LTM.Develop a clear feedback mechanism if AETHR's generated queries fail or return unexpected results, allowing it to self-correct.Section 3: Step-by-Step Implementation & Integration PlanThis plan outlines a phased approach to implement the enhancements.Phase 1: Foundational Database Overhaul (SQLite)Step 1: Define JSON Schemas for Memory Content.For each memory_type (e.g., github_repository_full_scan, interaction_log, idea, security_audit_hypothesis), define a clear, consistent JSON structure for its content.Action: Document these schemas.Step 2: Migrate content Column to JSON Text.Write a migration script to:Read existing pickled content from long_term_memory.Deserialize it.Convert it to the new JSON schema.Update the row, storing the JSON string in the content column (which should be altered to TEXT).Update ConsciousnessBrain.store_memory to serialize content to a JSON string.Update ConsciousnessBrain.load_memories to parse JSON string from content.Impact: Removes pickle dependency for core content, improves data accessibility.Step 3: Implement FTS5 for Full-Text Search.Create an FTS5 virtual table (e.g., ltm_fts) linked to long_term_memory.Index relevant text fields in this FTS5 table (e.g., the new JSON content, memory_type, and potentially extracted keywords from the JSON content).Update ConsciousnessBrain.retrieve_relevant_memories to use FTS5 MATCH queries for initial candidate selection based on keywords.Impact: Dramatically faster keyword-based searching.Step 4: Add Strategic B-Tree Indexes.Create indexes on long_term_memory(memory_type), long_term_memory(importance), long_term_memory(creation_time), long_term_memory(last_access), long_term_memory(content_hash).Analyze common query patterns from AETHR's tool use (once active) to identify further indexing needs.Impact: Speeds up metadata-based queries and sorting.Phase 2: Integrating True Semantic Search (ML Integration)Step 5: Select and Integrate Sentence-Transformer Model.Choose a suitable pre-trained model from the sentence-transformers library (e.g., all-MiniLM-L6-v2 for a good balance of performance and quality, or a larger model if resources permit).Modify ConsciousnessBrain._get_embedding to use this model to generate dense vector embeddings (e.g., 384 or 768 dimensions).Impact: AETHR can now generate meaningful semantic embeddings.Step 6: Store Real Embeddings.Alter the long_term_memory table's embedding column to BLOB.When storing a new memory, generate its embedding using the real model and store it as a packed binary representation (e.g., numpy.array(embedding).tobytes()).Write a migration script to re-calculate and store embeddings for existing LTM entries.Impact: Embeddings are now semantically rich and stored efficiently.Step 7: Implement Python-Side Similarity Search.In ConsciousnessBrain.retrieve_relevant_memories:Perform initial candidate filtering using FTS5 and/or metadata indexing to get a manageable subset of memories (e.g., top 100-500 candidates).For these candidates, load their stored BLOB embeddings and deserialize them (e.g., numpy.frombuffer(blob, dtype=numpy.float32)).Generate an embedding for the user's query/input text.Calculate cosine similarity between the query embedding and each candidate embedding.Re-rank candidates based on this semantic similarity score.Impact: Enables true semantic retrieval, finding conceptually similar memories even if keywords don't match exactly.Step 8: Refine Working Memory Loading.Update ConsciousnessBrain.load_working_memory to use the new hybrid retrieval (FTS + semantic re-ranking).Implement a scoring function that combines FTS relevance, semantic similarity, stored importance, recency, and access_count to select the top_n items for working memory.Impact: Working memory becomes more contextually relevant and intelligently populated.Phase 3: Advanced Memory Management & ToolingStep 9: Configurable and Adaptive Pruning.Move pruning thresholds (age, importance, access count) to a configuration file or environment variables.Implement an exponential decay factor for importance based on last_access time, where more frequent access slows decay.Impact: More flexible and potentially more intelligent memory retention.Step 10: Batch Database Updates for Access Counts.Instead of updating last_access and access_count on every retrieval, batch these updates. For example, AETHR could maintain a temporary in-memory counter for accesses and flush these to the DB periodically or on shutdown.Impact: Reduced write load on the database.Step 11: Refine database_query Tool & System Prompt.Ensure the execute_sqlite_query tool can gracefully handle more complex queries AETHR might generate (e.g., queries involving FTS5 MATCH syntax, or SQLite JSON functions if AETHR learns to use them).Provide AETHR with detailed examples in its system prompt on how to construct useful SQL queries for its LTM, including:Searching content: SELECT id, memory_type, json_extract(content, '$.description') FROM long_term_memory, ltm_fts WHERE ltm_fts.rowid = long_term_memory.rowid AND ltm_fts MATCH 'keyword' ORDER BY importance DESC LIMIT 5;Finding related memories (if connections field is used effectively).Retrieving specific types of memories within date ranges.Impact: AETHR gains more effective autonomous control over its LTM retrieval.Step 12: Implement Tool Use Feedback Loop.If AETHR's database_query tool call results in an SQL error, the error message should be fed back to AETHR.The prompt for the next turn should instruct AETHR to analyze the error and attempt to correct its query.Example: [TOOL_OUTPUT]: Database query error: no such column: descripton. Please check your query and try again, paying attention to table and column names.Impact: AETHR can learn from mistakes and improve its tool usage.Step 13: Sandboxed Code Execution for Database Maintenance (Advanced).(Consider carefully due to security) If AETHR proposes it and confirms, it could use its execute_sandboxed_code tool (with Python) to run scripts that perform more complex database operations, like:Generating custom reports from its LTM.Performing complex data migrations (if schema changes).Running integrity checks.This requires AETHR to generate safe and correct Python scripts that use the sqlite3 module.Impact: Potential for AETHR to self-manage and analyze its LTM more deeply.Phase 4: Iterative Refinement and Future DirectionsStep 14: Monitoring and Performance Profiling.Log query times, LTM size, pruning activity.Identify bottlenecks as the system scales.Step 15: Explore Dedicated Vector Database Integration.If Python-side similarity search on SQLite-retrieved embeddings becomes too slow, integrate a dedicated vector database (ChromaDB, FAISS with an index server, Qdrant) for storing and searching embeddings. SQLite would still hold metadata and JSON content, linking to embeddings by ID.Step 16: Advanced ML for Memory Management.Automated Summarization/Consolidation: AETHR could use an LLM tool to summarize clusters of related old memories into a new, more concise memory, then mark the originals for potential pruning.Predictive Retrieval: Based on ongoing dialogue or task context, an ML model could predict which LTM items are likely to be needed next, pre-loading them into a secondary cache.Step 17: User Interface for LTM Browsing/Querying.Develop a UI component that allows the human user to directly query or browse AETHR's LTM (respecting any privacy/security boundaries AETHR might develop).Step 18: Contextual Window Management for Working Memory.Instead of a fixed-size deque, explore dynamic context windows. For example, if AETHR is focused on analyzing a specific GitHub repository, its WM could be heavily biased towards memories related to that repo, temporarily "forgetting" less relevant topics. This is a complex cognitive modeling task.Step 19: Continuous Evaluation of AETHR's Memory Recall and Utility.Develop metrics or test scenarios to assess how well AETHR recalls and utilizes its LTM.Use AETHR's own self-reflection capabilities to identify areas where its memory access or recall is suboptimal.Section 4: Conclusion and Immediate Next StepsThis strategy provides a robust path to significantly enhance AETHR's memory system, moving from a basic implementation to one that incorporates advanced database features, machine learning for semantic understanding, and empowers AETHR with greater autonomy over its own knowledge.Immediate Next Steps (Focus on Phase 1):Schema Design: Finalize JSON structures for all memory content types.Serialization Migration: Implement the script to convert existing pickled data to JSON and update the store_memory/load_memories methods.FTS5 Implementation: Create the FTS5 virtual table and update retrieval logic to use it for keyword searches.Basic Indexing: Add the initial set of B-Tree indexes.This phased approach allows for iterative improvements, ensuring stability and measurable progress in AETHR's cognitive capabilities. The integration of tool calling for database interaction is central to AETHR truly having "free reign" over its LTM and overcoming working memory limitations.
